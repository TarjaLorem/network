I will use it for further development of projects:
-- The Headers tab display 
-- Preview tab
-- Response tab
-- Filters

I was interested in the principle DevTools recording, but I'm not sure I'll be using it somewhere.
In Headers I can watch information of headers associated with the resource.
I'm interested Preview, because Previews tab shows me information about JSON, image, and text resources.
Maybe Response. I can watch information of HTTP response data (if any).
